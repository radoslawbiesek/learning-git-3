        <h1>Enjoy the silence</h1>
        <h2><span>by </span>Depeche Mode</h2>
        <p>Words like violence <br>
            Break the silence <br>
            Come crashing in <br>
            Into my little world <br>
            Painful to me <br>
            Pierce right through me <br>
            Can't you understand? <br>
            Oh, my little girl</p>
        <p>All I ever wanted <br>
            All I ever needed <br>
            Is here in my arms <br>
            Words are very unnecessary <br>
            They can only do harm
        </p>
        <p>
            Vows are spoken <br>
            To be broken <br>
            Feelings are intense <br>
            Words are trivial <br>
            Pleasures remain <br>
            So does the pain <br>
            Words are meaningless <br>
            And forgettable
        </p>
        <p>
            All I ever wanted<br>
            All I ever needed<br>
            Is here in my arms<br>
            Words are very unnecessary<br>
            They can only do harm<br>
        </p>
        <p>All I ever wanted<br>
